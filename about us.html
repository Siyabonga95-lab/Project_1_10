        </header>
        <p>
            I am a college student who has a passion for anime, art, and storytelling. 
            I bring something different to the table — from animation and design 
            to writing scripts and composing music.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main goal is to prove that with hard work and dedication, students 
            can produce something on the same level as professional creators. 
            I also hope this project will inspire others to start their own creative 
            journeys and collaborate across skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got my inspiration from <strong>Bleach</strong>, an anime that showed me how 
            powerful storytelling and imagination can be. This project is for all anime lovers 
            who want to see more creativity come to life, especially here in South Africa 
            where anime is still growing.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not a company team — just me, a student, trying to bring something 
            positive to the anime world and to give others a chance to be heard.
