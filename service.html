      <h1>Our Services</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      As a student with a strong passion for anime, art, and storytelling, I started this project
      not only as a creative outlet but also as a way to support both established anime studios
      and small businesses trying to make their mark. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the depth and imagination of anime like <strong>Bleach</strong>, I want to
      provide creative contributions that show how students can stand alongside professionals
      in shaping the future of anime culture.

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>
    <p>
      The Cosmic Duel Project is built to support anime companies, independent creators,
      and businesses with fresh and unique ideas. Here’s how I can bring value:
    </p>

    <h3>Concept & Character Design</h3>
    <p>
      From sketches to polished designs, I create original characters and settings that can
      be used in manga, anime pitches, or branding projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Script & Story Development</h3>
    <p>
      Writing scripts and world-building has always been my passion. I help craft plots,
      dialogue, and lore that can fit into anime projects or promotional content.
    </p>

    <h3>Music & Mood Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      I experiment with soundtracks and background music ideas that can enhance mood,
      tone, and atmosphere for anime-style projects or small-scale animations.
    </p>

    <h3>Student Collaboration Platform</h3>
    <p>
      Even though I work alone, this project is a bridge. I invite other students and young
      creators to share ideas that companies might adapt, opening the door for new voices
      in the anime industry.
    </p>

    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <p>
      My services are open to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anime Studios</strong> — looking for new concepts, designs, or fresh perspectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Businesses</strong> — such as manga shops, merchandise stores, or indie creators who want anime-inspired branding.</li>
      <li><strong>Student & Fan Communities</strong> — groups that want to create collaborative projects, fan events, or even small animations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
    <p>
      I may be a student, but that is my strength: I bring originality, dedication, and
      a perspective unshaped by industry limits. I believe anime is for everyone, and my
      project exists to prove that creativity can come from anywhere — even a single
      dorm room.
    </p>
    <p>
      By working with me, companies and creators not only get unique ideas but also
      contribute to building a bridge between professionals and student creators.
